            <pre>
                The 'HikeIT!'' Website was made in 2020 because of the Principles of Software Engineering class taught at Neumont College of Computer Science.

                The team that developed this website is the HikeIT! Team. The team members are: Ann Broderick, Daniil Baydak, Matthew Carey, Spencer Crawford, Dani Ebert, and Zoe tdnn.

                The website was a product of work as it was used for the HikeIT! Team to be learning how to use Scrum methodology for creating software in a team.
